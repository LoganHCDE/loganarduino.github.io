      <h2>Answer to questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs.</strong>
          <p>Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs showing the voltage pulses as they turn on and off in sequence (each LED's line will be a series of square pulses staggered in time to match the scan forward and backward behavior).</p>

        <li>
          <strong>How many LEDs could you blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?</strong>
          <p>There are 14 sections for connecting unique LEDs. That would draw about 280 milliampere (assuming ~20 mA per LED).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?</strong>
          <p>At least 30 to 60 times a second (30–60 Hz), which aligns with common perceptual frame rates where flicker becomes difficult to notice.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment?</strong>
          <p>I tried to use Gemini to help build the circuit, but that didn't fully work. I asked it to find relevant videos which helped a lot. I also used Gemini to help fix my code; it annotated some of my code and I kept and edited those annotations afterward.</p>
